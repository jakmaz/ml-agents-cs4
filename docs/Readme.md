# ML-Agents Project - Computer Science Group 4

This project is based on the code from the `release_21` version of the official [ML-Agents repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents). Due to the complexity and messiness with the branches in the official repository, we decided to start fresh by downloading and working off the release code.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you'd like to clone the project code. Run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jakmaz/ml-agents-cs4
```

### 2. Open the Project in Unity Hub
Once you have cloned the repository, follow these steps to open the project in Unity Hub:

1. Open Unity Hub and click the **Add** button.

2. Navigate to the folder containing the project code (likely named `Project` in the cloned directory) and import it into Unity Hub.

3. Once the project is imported, you can open it in Unity. When opening the project, Unity may prompt you to download the correct version of the Unity Editor. Follow the instructions to download and install the required editor version.

### 3. Download the Correct Editor Version
When opening the project, Unity may prompt you to download the correct version of the Unity Editor. Follow the instructions to download and install the required editor version.

### 4. Running the App
After setting up the correct editor version, you should be able to run the app directly from Unity Hub.

### 5. Getting Started with ML-Agents
For setting a python environment as well as a basic introduction to working with ML-Agents, follow this [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/develop/docs/Getting-Started.md) from the official documentation.

### 6. Full Documentation
For a more comprehensive understanding of ML-Agents, visit the [official documentation](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/develop) for detailed instructions and resources.

## Task for now: Running the 3D Ball Agent as a Test

To verify that everything is working correctly, you can run the 3D Ball agent as a test. This is a simple environment included with the ML-Agents package that everybody should be able to run successfully:

1. **Open the 3D Ball Scene**  
   In the Project window, navigate to `Assets/ML-Agents/Examples/3DBall/Scenes` and open the `3DBall` scene file.

2. **Run the Scene**  
   Once the 3D Ball scene is loaded, press the **Play** button to run the environment and see the agent in action.

Everybody should be able to run this test to ensure that the ML-Agents environment is set up correctly.
